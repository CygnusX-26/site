            Shipping a technical project that you‚Äôre proud of is among the most
            validating and rewarding things you can do as a young person. The
            euphoria that comes with it makes you feel unstoppable. And, as
            software engineers, we‚Äôre extraordinarly lucky that simply doing the
            thing we love every day also counts as ‚Äúadvancing our careers‚Äù.
          </p>

            College is the best time in your life to wildly experiment and build
            cool, creative projects. But actually doing it is soooooooooo hard.
            Before you can ship something you feel proud of, you have to find
            something you‚Äôd enjoy building, feels unique, and allows you to
            learn new things, but not too many new things, otherwise you‚Äôll give
            up. Then, you have to find the time and motivation to actually build
            the thing‚Äîand you have to do this outside of your classes, which are
            already highly time-consuming and energy-draining, and also outside
            of constant social obligations.
          </p>
          <p>
            As students, we‚Äôre constantly being pulled in every direction‚Äîso
            it‚Äôs no surprise most students simply don‚Äôt bother, & graduate never
            having made something they‚Äôre proud of.
          </p>
          <p>
            If only there were a community full of friendly, weird, creative, &
            amazing people people who encouraged you to build projects, & helped
            you carve out real time in your schedule to do it. A community where
            you could finally find <span className="italic">your people</span>,
            who you connect with on a deep level. Who make you feel loved,
            valued, and seen for who you are, and who invite you to make magic
            with them.
          </p>
          <p>I mean, that would be life-changing, wouldn‚Äôt it?</p>
