                  <p>Dear Hacker,</p>
                  <p>
                    Shipping a technical project that you‚Äôre proud of is among the most
                    validating and rewarding things you can do as a young person.
                    College is the best time in our lives to do it‚Äîbut actually doing it
                    is soooooooooo hard. Before you can ship something you feel proud
                    of, you have to find something you‚Äôd enjoy building, feels unique,
                    and allows you to learn new things, but not too many new things,
                    otherwise you‚Äôll give up. Then, you have to find the time and
                    motivation to actually build the thing‚Äîall while being pulled in
                    every direction by academic and social oligations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It‚Äôs no surprise most students simply don‚Äôt bother, & graduate never
                    having made something they‚Äôre proud of.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If only there were a community full of friendly, weird, creative, &
                    amazing people people who encouraged you to build projects, & helped
                    you carve out real time in your schedule to do it. A community where
                    you could finally find <span className="italic">your people</span>,
                    who you connect with on a deep level. Who make you feel loved,
                    valued, and seen for who you are, and who invite you to make magic
                    with them.
                  </p>
                  <p>I mean, that would be life-changing, wouldn‚Äôt it?</p>
